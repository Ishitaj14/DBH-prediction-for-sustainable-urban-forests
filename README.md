# DBH-prediction-for-sustainable-urban-forests

This data science project invlolves developing a feature for the AI tool that predicts the “Diameter at Breast Height” of the trees to analyze the growth curves for each species which in turn can help in better management of urban forests. It includes data collection, pre-processing, analysis and prediction of DBH (Depth Breast Height) of urban forest trees of different species across Montreal, Canada. 
It is a is a part of the project which involves the creation of a recommendation and decision support system to immunize the (urban) forest
against global changes by maximizing the resilience and environmental services of trees. I had the opportunity to put into practice the techniques of indexing, data analysis and to contribute to the creation of learning algorithms (deep, reinforcement, etc.) dedicated to the project as well as the visualization of results and recommendations.
I was able to discover computer science research in a multidisciplinary context being from a chemical engineering background.
